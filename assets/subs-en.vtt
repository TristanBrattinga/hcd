00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.575
You will not
take her from me!

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:11.516
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:19.820
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind, until now-

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.559
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:26.599
Don't lecture me,
Obi-Wan.

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.192
I see through
the lies of the Jedi.

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:32.704
I do not fear the dark side
as you do.

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:36.476
I have brought peace...

00:00:36.577 --> 00:00:38.272
freedom, justice...

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.413
and security.

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:46.939
Don't make me kill you.

00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:51.538
Anakin, my allegiance
is to the Republic, to democracy!

00:00:51.648 --> 00:00:54.242
If you're not with me...

00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:57.185
then you're my enemy.

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:01.680
Only a Sith
deals in absolutes.

00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:06.694
I will do what I must.

00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:09.197
You will try.
